# AdvvanceCraft
AdvvanceCraft the game. the game i made. This is the official GitHub page.
please include the credit and notify me by email if you are going to distribute this game off the technic launcher.
if not you will be copyrighted and it will be taken down.
if you would like to help me develop my game, look at contributing.md for further details
if you want to request an idea for an upcoming update, you can send your ideas in an email.
i use a service called www.nofile.io to upload updates because i can afford a larger upload size from GitHub.
i will start a kickstarter campaign soon for a new computer for a better, and more amazing computer than the terrible $400 dollar laptop i use now(it can barely run). so if you want to donate, go ahead.
