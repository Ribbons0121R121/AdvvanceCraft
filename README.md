you can report bugs in the bugs topic. (obviously)
i use a service called www.nofile.io to upload updates because i can afford a larger upload size from GitHub.
i will start a kickstarter campaign soon for a new computer for a better, and more amazing computer than the terrible $400 dollar laptop i use now. so if you want to donate, go ahead.
